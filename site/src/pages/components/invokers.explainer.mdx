# Invoker Buttons

## Pitch in Code

```html
<button command="show-modal" commandfor="my-dialog">This opens a dialog</button>

<dialog id="my-dialog">This is the dialog</dialog>
```


## Introduction

Adding `commandfor` and `command` attributes to `<button>` and elements would
allow authors to assign behaviour to buttons in a more accessible and
declarative way, while reducing bugs and simplifying the amount of JavaScript
pages are required to ship for interactivity. Buttons with `command` will -
when clicked, touched, or enacted via keypress - dispatch a `CommandEvent`
on the element referenced by `commandfor`, with some default behaviours.

## Background

All elements within the DOM are capable of having interactions added to them. A
long while ago this took the form of adding inline JavaScript to an event
attribute, such as `<button onclick="other.open()"></button>`. Inline JavaScript
has (rightly so) fallen out of favour due to the security and maintainability
concerns. Newer pages may instead introduce _more_ JavaScript to imperatively
discover elements and call `addEventListener('click', ...)` to invoke the same
behaviour. These patterns reduce developer experience and introduce more
boilerplate and friction, while remediating security and maintainability
concerns. Some frameworks attempt to reintroduce the developer experience of
inline handlers by introducing new JavaScript or HTML shorthands, such as
React's `onClick={...}`, Vue's `@click=".."` or HTMX's `hx-trigger="click"`.

Handling clicking is only half of the problem though, and this proposal doesn't
seek to re-invent click handlers. Dispatching an action to a related element on
the click can also become chore-like depending on the framework of choice. Many
frameworks recommend associating a click event with a state change and having
the element to be invoked react to that state change. For example [the React
docs on Adding Interactivity][1] attach click handlers which set state.


[1]: https://react.dev/learn/adding-interactivity#state-a-components-memory

There has also been a rise in the desire to customise controls for components.
Many sites, for example, introduce custom controls for File Uploads or dropdown
menus. These often require a large amount of work to _reintroduce_ the built in
functionality of those controls, and often unintentionally sacrifice
accessibility in doing so.

With the new `popover` attribute, we saw a straightforward declarative way to
tell the DOM that a button was interested in being a participant of the popover
interaction. `popovertarget` would indicate to a browser that if that button was
interacted with, it should open the element the `popovertarget` value pointed
to. This allows for popovers to be created and interacted with - in an
accessible and reliable way - without writing any additional JavaScript, which
is a very welcome addition. While `popovertarget` sufficiently captured the use
case for popovers, it fell short of providing the same developer & user
experience for other interactive elements such as `<dialog>`, `<details>`,
`<video>`, `<input type="file">`, and so on. This proposal attempts to redress
the balance.

### Terms

- Invoke/Invoked/Invoking: The action of _Invoking_ refers to a complete press
  action of a button, using a Human Input Device (HID). If the HID is a mouse,
  this would be a `click` event. If the HID is a touch screen, this would be a
  press using a stylus or finger. If the HID is a keyboard this would be the
  `Space` or `Enter` (Carriage Return) key on the keyboard. For other HIDs such
  as eye tracking or pedals or game controllers, the equivalent expected "click"
  action should be used to invoke the element.
- Invoker: An invoker is a button control (that is a `<button type="button">`) that has a
  `commandfor` and `command` attribute set.
- Invoker Target: An element which is referenced to by an Invoker, via the
  `commandfor` attribute.

## Proposed Plan

In the style of `popovertarget`, this document proposes we add
`commandForElement`, and `command` as available attributes to `<button>`.

```webidl
interface mixin CommandElement {
  [CEReactions] attribute Element? commandForElement;
  [CEReactions] attribute DOMString command;
};

HTMLButtonElement extends InvokerElement
```

The `commandfor` value should be an IDREF pointing to an element within the
document. `.commandForElement` also exists on the element to imperatively
assign a node to be the invoker target, allowing for cross-root invokers (in
some cases, see
[the popovertarget attr-asociated element steps](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/common-dom-interfaces.html#attr-associated-element)
for more).

The `command` attribute (and the `.command` reflected property) is a freeform
hint to the invoker target. Command can be a "built-in" action or a "custom"
action. If `command` is not supplied then it is considered invalid and no
action will take place, and no event will be fired.

Custom command values _must_ start with a double dash (`--`), similar to the CSS
["dashed-ident"](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/dashed-ident)
syntax. This is a safe namespace to use, and browsers guarantee to _never_ have
built-in values starting with `--`. The only browser behaviour for those values
will be dispatching a `CommandEvent` on the invokee. This allows web developers
to create custom Invoke actions for their components.

Built-in interactive elements have built-in behaviours (detailed below) which
are determined by the `command` attribue/property. The built-in names _must not_
start with a `-`.

Valid commands (that is: custom commands or a valid built-in) will
dispatch CommandEvents, allowing custom code to take control of invocations (for
example calling `.preventDefault()` or executing custom side-effects).

Invokers will dispatch an `CommandEvent` on the _Invokee_ (the element referenced
by `commandfor`) when the element is _Invoked_. The `CommandEvent`'s `type` is
always `command`. The event also contains an `source` property that will reference
button that was enacted causing the `CommandEvent` to fire. The dispatched
`CommandEvents` are always non-bubbling, composed, trusted, cancellable events.

```webidl
[Exposed=Window]
interface CommandEvent : Event {
  constructor(CommandEventInit invokeEventInit);
  readonly attribute Element source;
  readonly attribute DOMString type = "command";
  readonly attribute DOMString command;
};
dictionary CommandEventInit : EventInit {
  DOMString command = "";
  Element source;
};
```

If an element also has both a `popovertarget` and the `commandfor`/`command`
attributes set, then `popovertarget` _must_ be ignored: `command` takes
precedence.

If a `<button>` is a form participant, or has `type=submit`, then `command`
_must_ be ignored. It also _must_ not submit the form it is attached to. 
Buttons like this are "author errors", and browsers may issue warnings in the
developer console explaining to the developer why this button doesn't work.

This means a `<button>` with `command`/`commandfor` that is inside a form
_must_ also have `type=button`.

### Example Code

#### Popovers

When pointing to a `popover`, `commandfor` acts much like `popovertarget`,
allowing the toggling of popovers.

```html
<button type="button" commandfor="my-popover" command="toggle-popover">Open Popover</button>
<!-- Effectively the same as popovertarget="my-popover" -->

<div id="my-popover" popover="auto">Hello world</div>
```

#### Dialogs

When pointing to a `<dialog>`, `command` can toggle a `<dialog>`'s
openness.

```html
<button type="button" commandfor="my-dialog" command="show-modal">Open Dialog</button>

<dialog id="my-dialog">
  Hello world!

  <button type="button" commandfor="my-dialog" command="close">Close</button>
</dialog>
```

#### Details

> Note: Invokers targeting a `<details>` element has been deferred from the initial release.

When pointing to a `<details>`, `commandfor` can toggle a `<details>`'
openness.

```html
<button type="button" commandfor="my-details" command="open">Open Details</button>
<!-- Can be used to replicate the `<summary>` interaction -->

<details id="my-details">
  <summary>Summary...</summary>
  Hello world!
</details>
```

#### Customizing `input type=file`

> Note: Invokers targeting a `<input>` element has been deferred from the initial release.

Pointing `commandfor` to an `<input type="file">` can act the same as the
rendered button _within_ the input; and can be used to declare a customised
alternative button to the input's button.

```html
<button type="button" commandfor="my-file" command="show-picker">Pick a file...</button>

<input id="my-file" type="file" />
```

#### Customizing video/audio controls

> Note: Invokers targeting `<audio>` and `<video>` elements has been deferred from the initial release.

The `<video>` and `<audio>` tags have many interactions, here `commandfor`
shines, allowing multiple buttons to handle different interactions with the
video player.

```html
<button type="button" commandfor="my-video" command="play-pause">Play/Pause</button>
<button type="button" commandfor="my-video" command="toggle-muted">Mute/Unmute</button>

<video id="my-video"></video>
```

#### Custom behaviour

_Invokers_ will dispatch events on the _Invokee_ element. Using a dash in the
command allows for custom JavaScript to be triggered without having to wire up
manual event handlers to the Invokers.

```html
<!-- Custom commands must contain a double dash! -->
<button type="button" commandfor="my-custom" command="--my-frobulate">Frobulate</button>

<div id="my-custom"></div>

<script>
  document.getElementById("my-custom").addEventListener("command", (e) => {
    if (e.command === "--my-frobulate") {
      alert("Successfully frobulated the div");
    }
  });
</script>
```

### Defaults

Depending on the target set by `commandfor`, invoking the button will trigger
additional behaviours alongside the event dispatch, depending on the value of
`command`. The following table represents how built-in invocations on specific
element types are handled.

When the `command` attribute is missing it will default to an invalid state.

| Invokee Element | `command` hint         | Behaviour                                                                                                  |
| :-------------- | :-------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `<* popover>`   | `'toggle-popover'`    | Shows the `popover` if closed, otherwise hides. Similar to `.togglePopover()`                              |
| `<* popover>`   | `'hide-popover'`      | Hides the `popover` if open, otherwise does nothing. Similar to `.hidePopover()`                           |
| `<* popover>`   | `'show-popover'`      | Shows the `popover` if closes, otherwise does nothing. Similar to `.showPopover()`                         |
| `<dialog>`      | `'show-modal'`        | If the `<dialog>` is not `open`, shows it as modal. Similar to `.showModal()`                              |
| `<dialog>`      | `'close'`             | If the `<dialog>` is `open`, close and use the button `value` for returnValue. Similar to `.close(value)   |

Further behaviours have been proposed, but need further design on exactly how 
they will behave based on implications such as accessibility, security,
interactivity, and how the button may need to respond to such actions.

| Invokee Element       | `command` hint          | Behaviour                                                                                                      |
| :-------------------- | :--------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `<details>`           | `'toggle'`             | If the `<details>` is `open`, then close it, otherwise open it                                                 |
| `<details>`           | `'open'`               | If the `<details>` is not `open`, then open it                                                                 |
| `<details>`           | `'close'`              | If the `<details>` is `open`, then close it                                                                    |
| `<dialog>`            | `'toggle'`             | If the `<dialog>` is `open`, then close it and use the button `value` for returnValue, otherwise open as modal |
| `<dialog>`            | `'cancel'`             | If the `<dialog>` is `open`, cancel the dialog                                                                 |
| `<select>`            | `'show-picker'`        | Shows the native picker. Similar to `.showPicker()` on the invokee                                             |
| `<input>`             | `'show-picker'`        | Shows the native picker. Similar to `.showPicker()` on the invokee                                             |
| `<video>`             | `'play-pause'`         | If the video is not playing, plays the video. Otherwise pauses it. Similar to `el.playing = !el.playing`       |
| `<video>`             | `'pause'`              | If the video is playing, pause the video. Similar `.playing = false`                                           |
| `<video>`             | `'play'`               | If the video is not playing, play the video. Similar to `.playing = true`                                      |
| `<video>`             | `'toggle-muted'`       | If the video is muted, it unmutes the video, otherwise it mutes it. Similar to `el.muted = !el.muted`          |
| `<audio>`             | `'play-pause'`         | If the audio is not playing, plays the audio. Otherwise pauses it. Similar to `el.playing = !el.playing`       |
| `<audio>`             | `'pause'`              | If the audio is playing, pause the audio. Similar `.playing = false`                                           |
| `<audio>`             | `'play'`               | If the audio is not playing, play the audio. Similar to `.playing = true`                                      |
| `<audio>`             | `'toggle-muted'`       | If the audio is muted, it unmutes the audio, otherwise it mutes it. Similar to `el.muted = !el.muted`          |
| `<*>`                 | `'toggle-fullscreen'`  | If the element is fullscreen, then exit, otherwise request to enter                                            |

Further to the initial ship we're also exploring implicit `command` or implicit
`commandfor` values where the value can easily be inferred.

### Accessibility

For built-in behaviours `command` attribute maps to specific accessibility
mappings which are placed on the button. The button may also use the
`commandfor` referenced element to gather other details (for example the state
of the element) to reflect that state on the button.

These mappings will happen implicitly on the browsers Accessible Nodes, and so
while (for simplicity) this secion refers to various `aria-` attributes,
buttons will not sprout these attributes in the DOM, but the effective
equivalent will be exposed to Assistive Technologies.

#### Buttons with `command=toggle-popover`, `command=hide-popover`, or `command=show-popover`

Buttons with these popover commands will implicitly receive
`aria-details=IDREF`, where `IDREF` matches that of the `commandfor` attribute,
under certain conditions while the popover is in the showing state.

<details>

<summary>Why?</summary>

Some Assistive Technologes allow users to press a keyboard shortcut to navigate
to the element pointed to by `aria-details`. This is useful in scenarios where
the popover is _not_ the invoking element's next accessibility sibling, such as if there are buttons
or other controls between the invoking button and the popover.

</details>

<br/><br/>

Browsers are expected to omit `aria-details` based on heuristics where it is redundant,
such as the contents of the popover being the next accessibility sibling to the invoking element, or while
the popover's contents are not traversable, such as when it is hidden, or not
in the DOM.

Browsers should also omit `aria-details` when the invoking button is a descendant
of the popover it refers to, for example a close button inside the popover.

Buttons will also implicitly receive an `aria-expanded` value. The state of the 
`aria-expanded` value will map to the state of the popover. When the popover is
open the button will have `aria-expanded="true"`, when closed,
`aria-expanded="false"`. If the button is an descendant of the popover then it
will be explictly set to `aria-expanded="undefined"`, indicating to assistive
technology that the expanded state is not applicable to this button.
This attribute will be recomputed whenever the popover changes state, such that
the button always reflects the state of expansion.

<details>
<summary>Why?</summary>

Some Assistive Technologies will announce the state of expansion while the
button is focussed, for example a `<button aria-expanded=false>File</button>`
may be announced by a screen reader as "File, button, collapsed", while
`<button aria-expanded=true>File</button>` may be announced by a screen reader
as `File, button, expanded`. This is helpful information for users who require
an alternative of the visual confirmation of the popover being rendered on
screen.

If the popover element is not in the DOM, browsers should ensure the button has
the `aria-expanded=false` state. Some websites may chose to render such
elements only when they are open, often referred to as "conditional rendering".
Browsers should aim to do their best to cater for this, and as such provide the
state under the assumpsion that a popover element may appear in the DOM on
press.

</details>

<br/><br/>

Buttons with these popover commands will also have focus restored to the
button when the popover closes. This will require the popover keeping a
reference to the opening button so that it can return the focus to that button.

<details>
<summary>Why?</summary>

It is important for keyboard users (or other users who rely on focus) to not
have their focus state lost when performing actions on the page. If the page
shows a new piece of navigable UI, and shifts the user's focus to that UI,
then it is important to restore focus when that UI closes, so that the user's
journey is maintained.

</details>

<br/><br/>

<details>
<summary>Other considerations not explicitly proposed.</summary>

##### aria-pressed

Given elements will have `aria-expanded`, adding `aria-pressed` would be
confusing or redundant, and as such won't be proposed for these buttons.

##### aria-controls

While `aria-controls` attempts to establish a similar style of relationship to
`aria-details`, `aria-details` sees broader support among various assistive
technologies, and it would be redundant to add both.

##### aria-haspopup=dialog

When the `commandfor=` element is a `<dialog>`, adding aria-haspopup=dialog is
a potentially viable attribute to add. Some Assistive Technologies will announce
that the button will open a dialog, for example
`<button aria-haspopup=dialog>Delete</button>` may be announced by a screen
reader as "Delete, button, opens dialog". However, buttons that open dialogs
rarely come with additional visual treatment, and so the lack of a visual
analog means that using this attribute likely provides surplus information
to users of assistive technologies that isn't otherwise provided. Additionally,
the _intent_ for `aria-haspopup` is more focused towards combobox popovers,
where the type of popover may be ambigious. As command buttons can be used for
more than just combobox controls, `aria-haspopup` is not present by default.

</details>

<br/><br/>

#### Buttons with `command=show-modal`

Buttons with this dialog command will also have focus restored to the button
when the dialog closes. This will require the dialog keeping a reference to the
opening button so that it can return the focus to that button.

<details>
<summary>Why?</summary>

It is important for keyboard users (or other users who rely on focus) to not
have their focus state lost when performing actions on the page. If the page
shows a new piece of navigable UI, and shifts the user's focus to that UI,
then it is important to restore focus when that UI closes, so that the user's
journey is maintained.

</details>

<br/><br/>

<details>
<summary>Other considerations not explicitly proposed.</summary>

##### aria-details

Exposing an `aria-details` relationship between the button and the dialog is
redundant. These relationships are useful only when the related element is
open and present on the page and the invoking button is still navigable. A
modal dialog renders the rest of the page inert meaning that it won't be
possible to navigate to the invoking button.

##### aria-controls

Similar to `aria-details`, `aria-controls` is not useful for a dialog that
is closed, and non-navigable for a dialog that is open as modal, so it would 
provide no benefit to add.

##### aria-pressed

The `aria-pressed` state is the incorrect type of association for elements
which conditionally appear on the page.

##### aria-expanded

Similar to `aria-details`, the `aria-expanded` state redundant, given the
dialog is opened as modal. For the user to have navigated to a button that
opens a modal dialog, the dialog must not be open. If the dialog is open then
the button will be inert, therefore non-navigable, therefore it is redundant
to provide it an implicit `aria-expanded=true` state also.

##### aria-haspopup=dialog

When the `commandfor=` element is a `<dialog>` it might seem `aria-haspopup=dialog` 
would be a potentially viable attribute to add. Some Assistive Technologies will announce
that the button will open a dialog, for example
`<button aria-haspopup=dialog>Delete</button>` may be announced by a screen
reader as "Delete, button, opens dialog". However, buttons that open dialogs
rarely come with additional visual treatment, and so the [lack of a visual
analog means that using this attribute likely provides surplus information](https://w3c.github.io/aria/#h-note-50)
to users of assistive technologies that isn't otherwise provided. Additionally,
the _intent_ for `aria-haspopup` is more focused towards combobox popovers,
where the type of popover may be ambigious. As command buttons can be used for
more than just combobox controls, `aria-haspopup` is not present by default.

</details>

<br/><br/>

#### Buttons with `command=close`

Buttons with this dialog command will implicitly receive `aria-details=IDREF`,
where `IDREF` matches that of the `commandfor` attribute, while the dialog is
in the showing state, and the button is not a descendant of the dialog.

<details>
<summary>Why?</summary>

A button that closes a dialog is very typically found inside of the dialog, but
in some cases it may be found outside, perhaps as a "toggle" style button which
opens and closes a dialog as non-modal. This button may be used to close an open
dialog that is shown as non-modal. It may be useful for a user to traverse into
the dialog before closing it, for example to check if they have unsaved changes
within the dialog.

</details>

<br/><br/>

Buttons will also implicitly receive an `aria-expanded` value, if they are not a
descendant of the `commandfor=` referenced element. The state of the
`aria-expanded` value will map to the state of the dialog's openness. When the
dialog is open the button will have `aria-expanded="true"`, when closed,
`aria-expanded="false"`. This will be recomputed whenever the dialog changes
state, such that the button always reflects the state of openness.

<details>
<summary>Why?</summary>

A button that closes a dialog is very typically found inside of the dialog, but
in some cases it may be found outside, perhaps as a "toggle" style button which
opens and closes a dialog as non-modal.

Buttons outside of the dialog may be used to close an open dialog that is shown
as non-modal. It may be useful for a user to traverse into the dialog before
closing it, for example to check if they have unsaved changes within the dialog.
It may also be useful to know if the dialog is already closed (as in its
`aria-expanded` state is false), as this may help the user make a decision to
whether or not they action the close button.

Given elements will have `aria-expanded`, adding `aria-pressed` would be
confusing or redundant, and as such won't be proposed for these buttons.

`aria-details`, `aria-details` sees broader support among various assistive
technologies, and it would be redundant to add both.

#### Other built-in `command=` types

The above commands are the core built-in command types which will be initially
shipping. Further built-in commands will be proposed on a case-per-case basis,
and additional aria or other logic will be considered with those at the time.

#### Custom `command=` types

Custom command types have accessibility requirements which will be hard to
determine based on the presence of the button and invokee alone. Consequently,
it is left to the implementer or user of the custom command to assign
appropriate aria markup to these buttons.

#### Elements with `commandfor=` but no `command=`

In this current proposal, elements without a `command=` attribute are
considered "author errors"; they will do nothing when invoked. These buttons
will recieve no additional implicit aria states.

### Invokers and Custom Elements

As the underlying system for invoke elements uses event dispatch, Custom Elements
can make use of `CommandEvent` for their own behaviours. Consider the following:

```html
<button type="button" commandfor="my-element" command="--spin-widget">
  Spin the widget
</button>

<spin-widget id="my-element"></spin-widget>
<script>

customElements.define(
    "spin-widget",
    class extends HTMLElement {
      connectedCallback() {
        this.addEventListener("command", (e) => {
          if (e.command === "--spin-widget") {
            this.spin();
          }
        });
      }
    },
  );
</script>
```

### Security

This proposal adds new capabilities in that elements can be interacted with
using HTML where prior these required scripting (read: JS). Care has been taken
within this proposal to ensure there are no substantially new security
implications, and that the risk is kept low.

In general, we should not grant significant new capabilities with or without
scripting, and seek other ways to mitigate security concerns.

Invokers, by design, have two security affordances:

- Without scripting, they require user interaction - the invoker button needs
  to be clicked for the browser to fire an Invoke Event. Scripts are able to
  synthesise the `InvokeEvent`, or the `click` event on the button - but
  scripts are already capable of causing the same interactions without Invokers.
- The `invoketarget` takes an IDREF which must reference an ID within the same
  document. `invokeTargetElement` can be assigned a cross-root element, but
  this requires scripting which means all actions are already possible.

To go into more detail, below is a brief summary of the security considerations
per interaction:

#### Popovers

This proposal allows opening and closing popovers with `invoketarget`. This is
already possible with `popovertarget`, and so there is no new capability here.

#### Dialogs

This proposal allows opening and closing `<dialog>` elements with
`invoketarget`. While this is new capability (prior to this proposal scripting
is required), it poses the same security considerations as popovers in that it
toggles the visiblity of a new element. Modal dialog elements are also placed
on the "top layer" which means they occlude other content. This is already
possible with popovers, which are also placed on the top layer, so while
buttons to open `<dialog>` elements is a new capability, it is not a novel new
security threat considering attackers could already craft a popover.

Modal dialogs also trap focus, such that focus can only be moved within
elements inside the dialog or the browser native controls (such as the URL
bar). This is considered to not pose a significant threat as the invoking
button requires user activation, the dialog cannot render outside of the
document frame (iframe or browser window) and so cannot occlude the browsers
Chrome, and there are built in gestures to close a dialog (such as the Esc key
via a `CloseWatcher`) that cannot be opted out of with or without invokers.

#### Details (proposed follow-on)

This proposal aims to allow opening and closing `<details>` elements with
`invoketarget`. This is not considered to be new capability, as it is already
possible to do this with the `<summary>` element.

#### Input (proposed follow-on)

It should be noted that input pickers (like the file picker dialog) render native
controls outside of the bounds of the document frame (iframe or browser window).
Due to this, the security implications of invoking these elements should be
carefully considered.

Scripts can call `.showPicker()` on form elements, and the picker will open.
There are some cross-origin restrictions, for example calling `.showPicker()`
on elements in a cross-origin context only works for `<input type=file>` or
`<input type=color>`.

It is also possible to wrap an `<input>` in a `<label>`, where invoking the
label will open the picker. This is quite common practice when trying to style
`<input type=file>` for example; dressing the `<label>` to look like a
`<button>` and hiding the `<input>`.

This proposal allows showing the pickers of input elements, for example an
invoker can target an `<input type=file>` and clicking the invoker will open
the operating systems file picker dialog. As stated above, this is already
possible with `<label>` elements, but care should be taken to ensure that
the same cross-origin restrictions apply for Invokers as they do for scripting.

#### Fullscreen elements (proposed follow-on)

Turning an element into a fullscreen needs to be carefully consdidered.
Scripting already allows this via the `.requestFullscreen()` API which, as the
name suggests, may not always be successful given the UA context. This API
requires the document context to be active, for example requiring a user
activation (this is true of invokers in the general case), it also requires
the Permissions Policy to allow for this behaviour, and requires the element to
not already be on the Top Layer.

All of these constraints should also be true for invokers opening fullscreen
elements. This means the only _significant_ new behavioural difference between
an invoker opening a fullscreen element vs the existing behaviour which
requires scripting, is that sanboxed iframes which disallow scripting but allow
fullscreen may now declare a button that can fullscreen. Consider the following:

```html
<iframe sandbox allow="fullscreen">
  <html id="invokee">
    <button type="button" commandfor="invokee" command="toggleFullscreen">Invoke</button>
    <button onclick="invokee.requestFullscreen()">Go fullscreen</button>
  </html>
</iframe>
````

In this example, the `<button onclick>` will do nothing as the iframe is
sandboxed and does not allow scripting. The `<button invoketarget>` will
fullscreen the element, however, as the `allow=fullscreen` Permission Policy is
enabled to allow fullscreen.

This is considered to be a low security threat, as it requires opt-in to the
fullscreen Permission Policy explitly via iframe attributes or scripting. We
will, however, continue to explore if this should be a possibility.

#### Media Elements (proposed follow-on)

This proposal allows video and audio elements to be controlled with buttons
outside of the browsers native video controls. This includes playing, pausing,
and toggling mute/unmute. Today this is only possible using scripting via the
equivalent scripting APIs: `.play()` / `.pause()` / `.muted=`. These APIs are
guarded by Permissions Policy, and so should the invoker equivalent. Some User
Agents can be configured to reject calls to `.play()`, and this should also be
true of invokers. As such the key new capability here is the ability to call
these APIs without scripting enabled. This is effectively the same concern as
fullscreen; the security model is guarded around the Permissions Policy.

There is also additional concern around the media element invokers being able
to circumvent autoplay policies. Invokers should not be able to circumvent
these. By design, invokers require a user interaction (clicking the button)
and so this should not circumvent autoplay policies.

#### Further proposals...

There are continued suggestions for new capabilities of Invokers, such as
[invoking picture-in-picture](https://github.com/openui/open-ui/issues/916).

Each of these will need to be taken into consideration on a case-per-case
basis. The following questions will need to be answered for each of these:

- Is it possible for the user to do this today with scripting?
- Is it possible for the user to do this today without scripting?
- Does this behaviour bypass scripting sandboxing rules, such as
  Permissions Policy or iframes?
- Does this enable buttons to invoke content that appears outside of the
  browser frame?

### PAQ (Potentially Asked Questions)

#### Why the name `command`? Why not `click`?

While `click` is a fairly well established name in the world of the web, it is
quite specific to the action from a user gesture, whereas invoke events notify
a related element that an interactive control is requesting action. In other
words, a `click` happens on the element being interacted with - the _invoker_,
while an `invoke` happens on the element the interactive control points to -
the _invokee_.

If the invokee were to recieve click events from the interactive control, this
would make it difficult to differentiate user interaction on the element vs on
invoking elements. Take for example a video player; clicking on the area which
renders the video may play/pause the video, but clicking on a video control may
cause different behaviours on the video. The extra controls _invoke an action
on the video_ but the user gesture was performed on the controls themselves.

Invokers _rely_ on click events for their behavior to work, and they are not
intended to replace them. Instead, invokers enhance click events to drive
behaviour on a different element. Consequently they need a new conceptual name
for this. Given the opportunity to supply a new name, `invoke` was settled on.

Given the new conceptual model of "command" it stands to reason that all related
concepts share the same name, as such `commandfor` and `command` were chosen
rather than, say, `clickfor`/`clickaction`. Similarly the event class is named
`CommandEvent` and the event name `command`.

#### Didn't this used to be called `invoke`? What happened?

The original proposal for Invoke Commands was to use the term `invoke`
exhaustively through the API, and so the attributes were originally named
`invoketarget`/`invokeaction` and the event named `InvokeEvent` with a type of
`invoke`. This was deemed too abstract, and standards groups and web developers
desired a simpler name. For those interested in the history, some conversation
that lead to changing `invoke` to `command` starts around here:
https://github.com/whatwg/html/issues/9625#issuecomment-2115718679

#### Do we have to always supply both? Can't we make `command` or `commandfor` implicit?

The original proposal had the concept of an "auto" `command` value which would
determine an exlicit command based on various heuristics, such as the target
element. This has been deferred for the initial ship, but may be explored
further. This is considred out of scope for the initial ship, however.

We may also explore the possibility of making `commandfor` implicit, for example
if a button is a descendant of a dialog, omitting `commandfor` may make sense.
This is also considered out of scope for the initial ship.

#### What about adding Invoker defaults for `<form>`?

Defaults for `<form>` are intentionally omitted as this proposal does not aim to
replace Reset or Submit buttons. If you want to control forms, use those.

#### What about adding Invoker defaults for `<a>`?

Defaults for `<a>` are intentionally omitted as this proposal does not aim to
replace anchors. If you intend to produce a page navigation, use an `<a>` tag.

### Why is `command`/`commandfor` limited to buttons?

This is by design, to allow for a "pit of success"; invoking actions on
non-button elements such as `<div>`s or `<a>`s creates many problems, especially
for non-interactive elements. While `<a>`s _are_ interactive, they should _only_
be used for page navigation and not for invoking other behaviours, and so
`command`/`commandfor` should not be allowed.

#### Why isn't `button[type=submit]` included?

This is not added by design. Submit inputs already have a default action:
submitting forms. If you want a button to control the submission of a form, use
`button[type=submit]`, if you want a button to control invocation of something
_other_ than a form then you should use `button[type=button]`.

#### Why isn't `button[type=reset]` included?

This is not added by design. Reset inputs already have a default action:
resetting forms. If you want a button to control the resetting of a form, use
`button[type=reset]`, if you want a button to control invocation of something
_other_ than a form then you should use `button[type=button]`.

#### Why isn't `input[type=button]` included?

This is not added by design. `input[type=button]` is a legacy element,
use of this element is discouraged in favour of `<button>`. So we only support
`<button>` elements.

#### What does this mean for `popovertarget`?

Whilst `command`/`commandfor` _does_ replicate `popovertarget`'s functionality,
the two will co-exist side by side for some while to enable a smooth transition.

It is, however, intended that `commandfor` will replace `popovertarget` leading
to `popovertarget`'s eventual deprecation.

#### Why doesn't command just call the JS API method?

HTML attribute values have different casing to method names, so for example an
attribute value of `show-modal` does not match the method name `showModal()`.
This requires manual mapping to the respective methods, but browsers - under the
hood - effectively map from these values to the respective methods. Similarly,
custom commands must be prefixed with a double dash (`--`). It is possible to
convert the dashed value to camel case, and use computed properties to call
methods, if that's desired:


```html
<button type="button" commandfor="my-element" command="--spin-widget">
  Spin the widget
</button>

<spin-widget id="my-element"></spin-widget>
<script>
  customElements.define(
    "spin-widget",
    class extends HTMLElement {
      connectedCallback() {
        this.addEventListener("command", (e) => {
          const method = e.command
            .slice(2) // remove the double dash
            .replace(/(-\w)/g, c => c[1].toUpperCase()); // dash-to-camel case
          if (method in this) {
            this[method](event);
          }
        });
      }
      spinWidget(event) {
        // ...
      }
    },
  );
</script>
```

#### Command seems limited, what if I wanted to add arguments?

Custom `command`s can be used in a freeform way, for your own elements. If
you feel it necessary you can invent your own DSLs for passing extra data using
this hint. For example:

```html
<button type="button" commandfor="my-counter" command="--add-1">Add 1</button>
<button type="button" commandfor="my-counter" command="--add-2">Add 2</button>
<button type="button" commandfor="my-counter" command="--add-10">Add 10</button>

<input readonly id="my-counter" value="0" />

<script>
  const counter = document.getElementById("my-counter");
  counter.addEventListener("command", (e) => {
    let addMatch = /^--add-(\d+)$/.match(e.command);
    if (addMatch) {
      counter.value = Number(counter.value) + Number(addMatch[1]);
    }
  });
</script>
```

You can also leverage the buttons `value` attribute to effectively parameterise
certain commands:

```html
<button type="button" commandfor="my-counter" command="--add-num" value="1">Add 1</button>
<button type="button" commandfor="my-counter" command="--add-num" value="2">Add 2</button>
<button type="button" commandfor="my-counter" command="--add-num" value="10">Add 10</button>

<input readonly id="my-counter" value="0" />

<script>
  const counter = document.getElementById("my-counter");
  counter.addEventListener("command", (e) => {
    if (e.command == '--add-num') {
      counter.value = Number(counter.value) + Number(e.invoker.value);
    }
  });
</script>
```

You could also use `data-*` attributes for even more granular control.
