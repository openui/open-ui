## The Pitch

Navigation bars with hover-triggered overlays, rich design items, and a hierarchy of links are a
common pattern across the web, as seen below.

<br />

Unfortunately, implementations across the web vary significantly in accessibility, keyboard
behavior, and other characteristics. Furthermore, navigation bars on the web often misuse the ARIA
application menu role for navigation "menus", creating a poor accessibility experience and
inconsistent behavior for all users.

Our **goal** is to offer an accessible and user-friendly alternative to the common, but often
misused ARIA menu pattern for site navigation. This allows authors to bring "mega menus" to their
users with predictable behavior and good accessibility.

A mega menu is a large, expandable navigation menu that displays multiple options in a single panel
when a user clicks or hovers over a navigation item. Unlike traditional dropdowns with a single
column of links, mega menus organize content into multiple columns with subcategories, often
incorporating visuals like images, icons, and text to provide an overview of a website's structure.

**Note** that this explainer only covers navigation menus, not application menus, which are covered
by the [Menu Elements Proposal](https://open-ui.org/components/menu.explainer/).

## The `<navigationbar>` element

The `<navigationbar>` element represents an in-page group of either links, or disclosure buttons
that display a popover consisting of the navigation bar's links. It defaults to a horizontal
orientation, and its child `<menuitem>` elements are flex items displayed in a row, however like the
application menus proposal, we are discussing an `orientation` attribute to support horizontal
navigation bars. See [Issue #1201](https://github.com/openui/open-ui/issues/1201) for more.

This element:

* Provides the implicit [`navigation`](https://w3c.github.io/aria/#navigation) ARIA role.
* Provides the correct keyboard and focus behavior, drawing from both the
  [Disclosure Navigation ~Menu~ Patter](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/disclosure/examples/disclosure-navigation/),
  [Disclosure Navigation Hybrid
  Pattern](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/disclosure/examples/disclosure-navigation-hybrid/),
  and the the [Menubar Pattern](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/menubar/).

## Accessibility

One goal of this proposal is to make the menu elements we propose accessible by default. To achieve
this in part, our proposal follows the ARIA Authoring Practices Guide (APG) for both the
[Disclosure Navigation ~Menu~ Pattern](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/disclosure/examples/disclosure-navigation/),
[Disclosure Navigation Hybrid Pattern](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/disclosure/examples/disclosure-navigation-hybrid/),
and best practices curated from accessibility experts as closely as possible; deviations are
discussed with accessibility experts and documented here to the best of our ability. This section
describes the concrete implications on our proposal.

We acknowledge the longstanding accessibility issues with navigation menus, and our proposal is an
attempt to bring accessible, feature-rich navigation bars to the web platform while avoiding the
pitfalls that accessibility experts have raised when application menus are misused as navigation
menus. See the Menu Elements proposal's
[§ How does this proposal relate to navigation menus?](#how-does-this-proposal-relate-to-navigation-menus)
section and [Issue #1193](https://github.com/openui/open-ui/issues/1193) for more information.

## FAQ

### Why not reuse the `<nav>` element?

We might! More discusson on how to make the `<nav>` element suitable for this use case is underway,
but for simplicity for now, we're introducing a new element to give us more flexibility when
impelementing new behavior, and to draw a clean boundary between our proposal and pre-existing
features. See [Issue #1194](https://github.com/openui/open-ui/issues/1194) for more.
