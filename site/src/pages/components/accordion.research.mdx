An accordion is a sequence of
[disclosure](/components/disclosure.research)
widgets in a row.

Some accordions are exclusive,
which means that at any moment in time,
only zero or one of the disclosure widgets can be open.
In an exclusive accordion, opening one of the items
closes any existing open item.
(Of the design systems below,
the accordion for Semantic UI is exclusive,
the accordion for Stardust UI can be exclusive or not exclusive,
and those for Carbon Design System, FAST, KoliBri, Lightning Design System,
and Lion are not exclusive.)
