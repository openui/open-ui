## Introduction

`<input>` and `<textarea>` are the bread and butter of user interaction, but 
their content is limited to plain content. In order to provide richer
experiences developers ultimately have two techniques at their disposal: to
"hack" inputs by surrounding or overlaying/underlaying elements which, aside 
from the difficulty to implement, can be extremely fragile and error prone. 
The other solution is to make the leap to using `contenteditable` which brings
its own set of problems, leading to an out-of-the box inacessbile experience
and requiring a large amount of remediation work to get to net-zero.

This proposal introduces a set of smaller functionality around `<input>`s and
`<textarea>`s that collectively aim to allow developers to build out richer
input controls for the web. They can be roughly broken down into four themes:

- Give developers the ability to extract range information from an `<input>`
  or `<textarea>`.
- In turn, allow developers to apply CSS Highlights to those ranges, to allow
  for parts of an inputs value to be styled.
- Provide "input masking" to allow for presentational characters to be added
  to inputs, improving usabiltiy for complex constrained inputs, for example
  dates, currencies, PINs, and so on.
- Provide an API for making "suggestions" within an input which users can
  accept or reject to aid in data entry.

While each of these is a *discrete* proposal for new APIs, and each has
descrete use cases, the combination of these features unlock additional use
cases and can allow developers to solve novel problems far more easily.

## A note on contenteditable

Generally speaking, all of the above *could* be solved by utilising the
`contenteditable` attribute. However, `contenteditable` is very complex to
effectively utilise and has a litany of additional complexities to resolve,
in order to get an equivalent experience
([1](https://medium.com/medium-eng/why-contenteditable-is-terrible-122d8a40e480),
[2](https://quip.com/blog/quip-editor-a11y),
[3](https://discuss.prosemirror.net/t/contenteditable-on-android-is-the-absolute-worst/3810)),
and has various longstanding compatibility issues
([1](https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=105323),
[2](https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=258052),
[3](https://issues.chromium.org/issues/40824135),
[4](https://issues.chromium.org/issues/40788742)). While it's possible to
resolve cross-browser issues, the fundemental design of `contenteditable`
requires a significant amount of work to migrate from traditional form fields.

This proposal (or set of proposals) aims to bridge the gap; extending existing
`<input>` & `<textarea>` elements functionality so that developers do not need
to reach for `contenteditable` (or other hacks) quite so often, in the hope
that the web retains a high degree of accessibility into the future.

## Range Information

https://github.com/whatwg/html/issues/10614, https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/10346

Today it is possible to get `Range` information from nodes. The `Range`
interface specifies a region of text within a node, and can be used to drive
Selection and Highlights. It is not possible to use `Range` interfaces to
select part of an `<input>` or `<textarea>`s live value.

### Why would we need Range information?

Range information is useful for two main reasons:

- Getting the bounding `DOMRect` can be useful to anchor popover or other 
  decorative elements to the current selection, the caret, or a specified
  range.
- Passing the `Range` to the CSS highlight API could enable richer inputs
  without having to go to extreme lengths to style portions of an inputs
  value.

<figure>
  <figcaption>Fig 1. A screenshot of a GitHub comment box, showing a popover anchored to a region of text.</figcaption>
  <img src="/images/rich-inputs/github-comment-plus-1.png" style="border-radius:10px" alt="A screenshot of the GitHub comment box. The comment reads 'This LGTM :+'. The ':+' syntax has caused an autocomplete popover to open with the thumbs up emoji, labelled as '+1'." />
</figure>

<figure>
  <figcaption>Fig 2. A screenshot of the QuillBot website, showing a popover hint for correcting gramatical errors.</figcaption>
  <img src="/images/rich-inputs/quill-suggestion.png" style="border-radius:10px" alt="A screenshot of the QuillBot editor. The prose inside reads 'I take for granite some peoples poor grammar.'. The words 'granite' and 'peoples' have red underlines indicating they're incorrect. The mouse cursor is placed over the top of the word granite which has opened a popup with the content 'Correct the spelling error, granite (strikethrough), granted'." />
</figure>


### Problem Statement

Today, it is *not* possible to extract `Range` information from a `<textarea>`
or `<input>` value. Trying to do so will result in selecting the node
representing the initial value of the `<textarea>`, or nothing in the case of
`<input>` elements.

```html
<textarea id="field">This is the textarea initial value</textarea>
<script>
  const r = new Range()
  r.setStart( field.children[0], 13 )
  r.setEnd( field.children[0], 21 )
</script>
```

The above JavaScript will select the text node that represents the field's
initial value, but not the values *current* value.

### How this is solved today

For developers that wish to extract such Range information for the current
value, they will need to duplicate the `<textarea>` element into a new node,
assign the `.textContent` to the field `.value`, and then extract range
information from that:

```html
<textarea id="field">This is the textarea initial value</textarea>
<script>
  const r = new Range()
  const fakeField = document.createElement('div')
  fakeField.textContent = field.value
  const styles = getComputedStyle(field);
  for (let i = 0; i < styles.length; i += 1) {
    const name = styles[i];
    fakeField.style[name] = styles[name];
  }
  field.insertAdjacentElement(fakeField, 'afterend')
  r.setStart( fakeField.children[0], 13 )
  r.setEnd( fakeField.children[0], 21 )
</script>
```

This will provide a Range interface that can provide the user *some* information,
such as the bounding `DOMRect`, but it is computationally expensive to clone the
element and all of its styles simply to get the `DOMRect`, and would need to be
re-done for any style changes (such as changing writing direction) and yet more
work is needed to manage selections correctly.

GitHub's `<text-expander-element>` is a Custom Element built to handle this
specific use case, and powers the Emoji, Issue and At-Mention suggestions
inside comment fields. In order to do this, it uses an underlying library -
[dom-input-range](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dom-input-range) which uses
the above described technique of copying the textarea in order to extract
`Rects`.

<figure>
  <figcaption>Fig 3. A screenshot of a GitHub comment box, showing the popover that uses this technique.</figcaption>
  <img src="/images/rich-inputs/github-comment.png" style="border-radius:10px" alt="A screenshot of the GitHub comment box. The comment reads 'Did you know every time you type #@ or : into a GitHub comment box it needs to duplicate the contents of the textarea and copy over all of the styles so it can get the caret position to render this box: :'. The last colon has an autocomplete popover anchored next to it, showing a list of possible emoji." />
</figure>

### How we'd like to solve this in the future

Here are two possible paths to solving this:

#### Expanding `Range`

Expanding the `Range()` interface's `.setStart()` and `.setEnd()` to
select the live value of an `<input>` or `<textarea>` element.

This would transparently ensure that, when given a `<textarea>` or
`<input>`, `setStart()` would use the live value instead of the child
nodes (where applicable). This comes with compatibility risks, where
existing callsites that pass these values in may result in new selections
in surprising ways. Additionally, this opens a potential for composed
Ranges which select content adjacent to, as well as inside, the field -
which is potentially undesirable and not currently possible today.

#### Adding a new `Range` type

Adding a new `InputRange()` sub-class of `Range()`, the exclusive purpose
of which is to create ranges on `<input>` and `<textarea>` elements. The
`.setStart()` and `.setEnd()` methods would *only* allow `<textarea>` or
`<input>` as a Node, and would otherwise throw an Error.

This would increase the API surface area of the web platform, but on the
other hand it side-steps the issues around transparently extending Range.
The `InputRange()` interface offers a natural boundary layer between other
`Range` elements and avoids selection compositio issues for APIs where
`Range` can span multiple nodes. The CSS highlight API, for example, can
special case `InputRange`. Additionally, a separate interface can side-step
potential security issues, for example serialising with `.toString()` could
throw, the `.surroundContents()` function can be elided, and so on.

## CSS Highlights on inputs

[CSS highlights](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CSS_Custom_Highlight_API)
are a new API to style text ranges in a given node, using the `::highlight`
pseudo element. This same API would be very useful for *also* styling ranges
inside of an `<input>` or `<textarea>`.

### Why would we need CSS highlights in `<input>` or `<textarea>`?

Today, it is a common UI pattern to decorate regions of text within an input
for example to suggest potential spelling or gramatical mistakes, syntax
highlighting, or to highlight side-effectful regions of a message:

<figure>
  <figcaption>Fig 4. A screenshot of the GitHub Search UI, showing syntax highlighting of the search.</figcaption>
  <img src="/images/rich-inputs/github-search.png" style="border-radius:10px" alt="A screenshot of the GitHub search bar. The value reads 'repo:github/github AND language:Rust /here_is_a_regexp/'. Most of the text is black, but portions of the value are highlighted: 'github/github' and 'Rust' both have a dark blue foreground color with a light blue background. The word 'AND' has a purple foreground, and '/here_is_a_regexp/' is stylised with a dark blue foreground."/>
</figure>

<figure>
  <figcaption>Fig 5. A screenshot of the Slack message UI, highlighting of mention keywords.</figcaption>
  <img src="/images/rich-inputs/slack-message.png" style="border-radius:10px" alt="A screenshot of the Slack message UI. The value reads 'Hey @here! I'm gonna ping all of you needlessly!'. The '@here' is stylised to have a light yellow foreground on a dark yellow background."/>
</figure>


### Problem Statement

Today, it is not possible to get Range information from input and textareas
(see above) and therefore it is also not possible to supply ranges to the CSS
highlights API. Unlocking the facility to provide CSS highlights to input
ranges would make it much easier to create this kind of UI, which is otherwise
very difficult to achieve.

### How this is solved today

Aside from contenteditable it is possible to overlaying (or underlay) an input
with a `<div>`; tracking the user's input, rendering a richer version into the
`<div>`. GitHub's search bar does exactly this, setting the `color` &
`background-color` of the `<input>` to `transparent` which allows sighted
users to see the `<div>` that is sitting below. As the user inputs text,
the `<div>` sitting below is populated with a syntax-highlighted variant of
the input. This is tricky to get right and remains fragile; the source of many
bugs. Correctly tracking composition events, for example, can be challenging
([refer to this bug report during a private beta ship of this
feature](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/112806#discussioncomment-10159202)).
Additionally there are myriad ways to break the effect, such as forced fonts,
text-zoom, or changing writing directions, which all need to be actively
mitigated:

<figure>
  <figcaption>Fig 6. A video demonstrating how to break the layered effect by changing writing direction.</figcaption>
  <video style="border-radius:10px" controls>
    <source src="/images/rich-inputs/github-search-dir.mp4" type="video/mp4"/>
  </video>
</figure>

### How we'd like to solve this in the future

Extending the `CSS.highlights` API to accepting ranges from input elements (see
above proposal on `InputRage`) would solve this simply and effectively.

It would also be useful (though not necessary) to extend the CSS highlights API
to allow for styling the `cursor`, `caret-color` & `outline` properties in the
way that both `::spelling-error` and `::gramma-error` allow today.

### Text automcomplete suggestions, aka "Ghost Text"

A common UI pattern is having "predictive" suggestions that provide the rest of
the word or sentence you're typing. Often these can be contextually aware, for
example the predictive model can be programmed around (or trained on) data
within the product.

<figure>
  <figcaption>Fig 7. A screenshot of gmail's "Smart Compose" feature, which surfaces autocomplete suggestions via a "ghost-text" UI.</figcaption>
  <img src="/images/rich-inputs/gmail-ghost-text.png" style="border-radius:10px" alt="A screenshot of the gmail compose email popover. The value reads 'gmails 'Smart compose' feature offers predictive suggestiosn via 'ghost text' ui. Per my pr-'. In lower contrast text, gmail has inserted text running on to the end of the sentence 'revious email', making the last sentence read 'Per my previous email'."/>
</figure>

<figure>
  <figcaption>Fig 8. A screenshot of GitHub's "Copilot Text Completion" feature, which surfaces autocomplete suggestions via a "ghost-text" UI.</figcaption>
  <img src="/images/rich-inputs/github-ghost-text.png" style="border-radius:10px" alt="A screenshot of the GitHub comment editor. The value reads 'GitHubs PR descriptions now offer tex'. In lower contrast text, GitHub has insert text running on to the end of the sentence 't completion suggestions, making the sentence read 'GitHubs PR descriptions now offer text completion suggestions'."/>
</figure>

### Why would we need "Ghost Text" in the browser?

This is a common UI pattern and is likely to get more common with the
proliferation of LLMs especially as their availability increases in the web
platform with APIs such as [WebNN](https://www.w3.org/TR/webnn/) or the
[Writing Assistance APIs](https://github.com/WICG/writing-assistance-apis).

It's also a very difficult effect to achieve for multiline inputs, due to
the limitations of `<textarea>`.

### How is this solved today?

Like the other solutions, its possible to cheat this effect by underlaying/
overlaying an element such as a `<div>` and copying over the content. Like
the others this comes with the usual problems of tracking styling (such as
writing direction), but there are other issues when it comes to multiline
input and setting a value:

- Textareas need to be carefully styled to avoid overlapping text which will
break anti-aliasing fonts:

<figure>
  <figcaption>Fig 9. A video demonstrating overlapping text which causes a boldening effect.</figcaption>
  <video style="border-radius:10px" controls width="900px">
    <source src="/images/rich-inputs/github-text-bolding.mp4" type="video/mp4"/>
  </video>
</figure>

- In some cases a suggestion can cause a line break as the word needs to wrap,
but the users currently input text does not cause a wrap, this is especially
noticable with "follow through" typing (typing the characters matching the
presented suggestion):

<figure>
  <figcaption>Fig 10. A video of "follow through" typing on a GitHub suggestion, demonstrating the line wrapping issue</figcaption>
  <video style="border-radius:10px" controls width="900px">
    <source src="/images/rich-inputs/github-follow-through-typing.mp4" type="video/mp4"/>
  </video>
</figure>

This is resolvable by editing the input value to add newline characters, but
this breaks the user's undo/redo history, and requires a lot of complex state
tracking.

- Undo history itself is quite difficult to track, and can frequently disturb the
suggestion:

<figure>
  <figcaption>Fig 11. A video demonstrating the "Undo" feature and how it disrupts the auto-suggest feature.</figcaption>
  <video style="border-radius:10px" controls width="900px">
    <source src="/images/rich-inputs/github-undo-bugs.mp4" type="video/mp4"/>
  </video>
</figure>

In addition to these various bugs, making an accessible and discoverable
interface for suggestions has been challenging.

### How we'd like to solve this in the future

Extending the `HTMLInputElement` and `HTMLTextAreaElement` interfaces to
include an API to accept and commit suggestions, and have the browser surface
this in a manner cohesive to platform conventions would greatly alleviate the
amount of engineering effort required to present this UI. A proposed sketch for
such an API:

```webidl
interface SuggestionValueMixin {
  undefined suggestValue(DOMString replacementValue);
  undefined clearSuggestedValue();

  attribute EventHandler onsuggestioncommit;
  attribute EventHandler onsuggestiondismiss;
}

HTMLInputElement includes SuggestionValueMixin;
HTMLTextAreaElement includes SuggestionValueMixin;
```

In addition, it would be useful to have the regions of text that are additions
to the text be selectable via a pseudo-element selector, perhaps `::suggestion`
or `::suggestion(n)` if multiple regions of suggested text are allowed.

One issue with this API is that suggesting a complete replacement value would
mean being able to handle differences such as deletions, which is a far less
common UI pattern. Consequently we could look to design an API which inserts
only additions at precise locations:

```webidl
interface Suggestion {
  constructor(DOMString insertedValue, int position)
}

interface SuggestionValueMixin {
  undefined suggest(Suggestion suggestion);
  undefined clearSuggestion(Suggestion suggestion);

  attribute EventHandler onsuggestioncommit;
  attribute EventHandler onsuggestiondismiss;
}

HTMLInputElement includes SuggestionValueMixin;
HTMLTextAreaElement includes SuggestionValueMixin;
```

The developer would be expected to know which character position to insert the
suggestion, but the upside is that it is much simpler for the developer to
anticipate (and for the browser to calculate) where the additions go.

### Input Masking

https://github.com/whatwg/html/issues/7794

[Input masking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Input_mask) is a technique used
to separate fragments of a text input into a more recognisable pattern. This
long contigous strings (such as large numbers or product keys) much easier to
read, as they can be formatted to aid in pattern recognition. For example:

- Credit card numbers separated into 4 segements of 4 characters each,
  separated by spaces (e.g. `4556 6059 2941 7661`).
- Separating postal codes with spaces (e.g. `SE1 7PB`)
- Formatting currencies based on locale, for example using a `,` to separate
  each set of 3 digits (e.g. `1 000 000 000`).
- Formatting dates into a set of two digits for the month & day, and four
  digits for the year, divided by slashes or dashes (e.g. `01/01/2025`).
- Telephone numbers according to the regions locale, which may include dashes,
  parenthesis, or spaces (e.g. `(555) 876 5309`).
- IPv4 addresses into 4 chunks separated by `.`s (e.g. `192.168.1.1`).

### Problem Statement

Creating these kinds of masked inputs requires a lot of effort and typically
involves combining multiple inputs into one (which can cause issues with
copy/paste or deleting inputs), or by injecting characters into inputs (which
can cause issues around undo/redo history, and limits the ability to style the
masked characters separately from user input).

Many implenentations in the wild fail due to usability concerns, or they fail
various WCAG critera ([some excellent reading material on the
topic](https://giovanicamara.com/blog/accessible-input-masking/). Providing a
native implementation can alleviate this by creating a simple to use accessible
out of the box experience.

### How is this solved today?

Many libraries exist to provide this functionality for the web. A
non-comprehensive alphabetical list:

 - [Alpine.js Mask](https://alpinejs.dev/plugins/mask)
 - [AutoNumeric](https://www.npmjs.com/package/autonumeric)
 - [inputmask](https://robinherbots.github.io/Inputmask/)
 - [imask](https://imask.js.org/)
 - [jQuery Mask Plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jquery-mask-plugin)
 - [Maskito](https://maskito.dev/)
 - [CleaveJS](https://nosir.github.io/cleave.js/)
 - [v-mask](https://www.npmjs.com/package/v-mask)

Many spreadsheet applications such as Excel provide built-in input masking.

Other languages, platforms and frameworks provide masking as a UI primitive or
have equivalent libraries in their ecosystems, for example .Net's
[`maskedtextbox.mask`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.windows.forms.maskedtextbox.mask?view=windowsdesktop-6.0),
or the [`edittext-mask`](https://github.com/egslava/edittext-mask) third party
Android library.

Most libraries expose a microsyntax for expressing the presentational
characters of the input, vs the characters the user inputs. The majority
(Alpine, inputmask, maska, imask, v-mask, jQuery Mask) define
the following characters as special:

- `9` represents an numeric character of the user input (in maska & v-mask this
  is instead the `#` symbol).
- `A` represents an alpha character of the user input (in maska this is instead
  the `@` symbol).
- `*` represents an alphanumeric character of the user input (in v-mask this is
  instead the `N` symbol).
- all other characters represent their respective literal value, as a mask
  character.

Given the above, this means the following examples will work:

- `999,999,999` is a mask which will allow numeric input, that will add a
  comma every third digit, so the user inputting `123456789` will result in the
  input visually displaying `123,456,789`.
- `(999) 999-9999` is a mask allowing numeric telephone number style input,
  and will add the `(`, `) ` and `-` substrings to the input, thus a user
  inputting `5558765309` will result in a rendered input of `(555) 876-5309`.

### How we'd like to solve this in the future

Extending the `HTMLInputElement` to include a `mask` attribute that allows
for a microsyntax featuring the `A`, `9` and `*` characters seems like a
reasonable step forward. Any literal characters will be filled in as the user's
input reaches the required length. The `::masked` or `::masked(n)` pseudo
element selector can be used to select the regions of masked text to style
appropriately. The input's value will not change, as the masked characters are
presentational only.
